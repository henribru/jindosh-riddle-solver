At the dinner party were Lady Winslow, Doctor Marcolla, Countess
Contee, Madam Natsiou, and Baroness Finch.

The women sat in a row. They all wore different colors and Baroness
Finch wore a jaunty red hat. Lady Winslow was at the far left,
next to the guest wearing a blue jacket. The lady in white sat left of
someone in green. I remember that white outfit because the woman
spilled her wine all over it. The traveler from Dunwall was dressed
entirely in purple. When one of the dinner guests bragged about her
War Medal, the woman next to her said they were finer in Dunwall,
where she lived.

So Doctor Marcolla showed off a prized Ring, at which the lady from
Fraeport scoffed, saying it was no match for her Bird Pendant.
Someone else carried a valuable Diamond and when she saw it,
the visitor from Karnaca next to her almost spilled her neighbor's
absinthe. Madam Natsiou raised her whiskey in toast. The lady from Dabokva,
full of beer, jumped up onto the table, falling onto the guest in the
center seat, spilling the poor woman's rum. Then Countess Contee
captivated them all with a story about her wild youth in Baleton.

In the morning, there were four heirlooms under the table: the War Medal,
Snuff Tin, the Bird Pendant, and the Diamond.

But who owned each?
